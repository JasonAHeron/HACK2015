       Welcome to your UCSC Study Session Scheduler!  We are so happy that you have chosen to be a better student by deciding to
       join a study group.  If you haven't already, please visit our website to create requests for study groups.  
       <br>
       To submit a request to form a study group:<br>
          1. After clicking "Log In" and entering your email address and password, click "Create a New Study Session".<br>
          2. Next to "Select a Class", enter the name of the class that you would like to form a study group.<br>
          3. Select the minimum time for a study session (the minimum amount of time you wish to study).<br>
          4. Select the minimum number of people in a study session (a minimum of 2 would mean you and at least one other person).<br>
          5. Select any potential locations of the study session.  For locations on or off campus, email addresses of the members
             of a study session will be shared so that a study location can be agreed upon.<br>
          6. Select how often you would like to meet.  Once a week recurrence will automatically check for study sessions times
             every week.<br>
          7. Select "next".<br>
          8. On the following screen, click and drag on the calendar to select times that you are unavailable.  As you select these<br>
             times, the blocks will turn red.<br>
          9.  After you have selected all the times that you are not available, select "Create New Study Session".<br>

        Once you have created a study session, you can view any pending sessions, sessions that have not been matched to the current<br>
        criteria, under "Pending Sessions".  Any sessions that have found matches can be found under "Scheduled Sessions".<br>

        To edit times that you are available, go the "My Schedule" and click and drag to edit the times available.<br>

        To edit your account settings, go the "Account Settings".  To change your email, password, phone number, or notification<br> settings, click the corresponding "Edit" button to make the field editable.  To save your changes, press the corresponding<br> 
        "Save" button.<br>

        If a study session is created due to your request, you will receive an email notification detailing the emails of the other<br>
        members of the study groups and study session location and time.<br>

        Thank you so much for taking advantage of this wonderful tool!  We hope it helps you succeed in your classes!

        Sincerely,

        Team Sexy Magic
